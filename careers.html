                      <p>This is a stand-alone role in a fast paced, dynamic and entrepreneurial organisation with a
                        strong social mission. There’s a lot to do to support BoxUp Crime in its growth, so the ideal
                        candidate will be someone who can make an immediate impact with minimal supervision, support or
                        guidance. In return, the post holder will have a lot of scope to make the role their own and
                        become an integral part of organsation as it grows and evolves.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The role would be ideal for someone with at least one to two years’ experience in a similar
                        administrative or customer service role who is looking to make their next career move or
                        someone with strong administrative experience who is looking to find a workplace environment
                        where they can really make a positive social impact. This is a highly autonomous and varied
                        role so the ideal candidate will need to demonstrate initiative, common sense pragmatism,
                        flexibility and a genuine willingness to pitch-in with whatever needs to be done.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Our mission and values are at the heart of everything we do at Box Up Crime and we’re looking
                        for someone who truly wants to be part of what we’re trying to achieve. This role will interact
                        with a wide range of stakeholder groups including schools, government bodies, funders, and the
                        young people we support. The post holder will need to be able to communicate with
                        professionalism, and demonstrate tact, empathy and discretion. As the first point of contact
                        many people will have with Box Up Crime, we expect the post holder to be a true ambassador for
                        our mission.

            Our mentoring programmes are very successful and work on the great relationship we have with young people
            and
            the trust of our stakeholders. We currently hold a contract with a Youth Offending Team to deliver
            mentoring to young people both in
            custody and the community. The aim of this particular project is to provide the support to assist the young
            person maintain or re-engage with education, training and employment, as well as helping to remove the
            barriers that young people may have to making positive life changes.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Our mentors have very positive links with young people within the community. They have good knowledge of
            the issues facing young people in the local areas and also any potential opportunities. Our mentors deliver
            a number of sessions within the community, schools and pupil referral units.
          </p>
          <p>
            BoxUp Crime mentors are experienced in working with young people who are at risk of or involved in,
            criminality, serious youth violence and social exclusion. They are DBS checked, trained in conflict
            resolution, safeguarding and data protection. We are
            committed to an ongoing training and development programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mentors draw from their experience and have their own positive testimonials to share.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Our flexible programs have been commissioned by the Mayor’s office. That means we’ve been able to work with
            young offenders in Barking & Dagenham, with access to agencies including the probation services and young
            offenders services. We’ve got a proven track record of not only getting in touch with hard-to-reach young
            people, but in helping them move on from gang life.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also understand that leaving a gang is only the start, which is why we offer support that goes beyond
            the immediate problem. Through our programmes, ex-gang members have access to job opportunities,
            qualifications, training and business start-up mentoring.
